Fitness Monitor is an Android application that users can use to track their daily activities like walking, jogging, sitting, standing, walking upstairs and walking downstairs. The application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict user activity automatically and stores the information in a database stored on the phone. The users can then choose to visualize the statistics.
